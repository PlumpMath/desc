#TODO monolithic for all things or allow manager managers?
    #personally I would prefer monolitic for sake of simplicity
    #and frankly uint32 has more indexes than we will ever need
#the main question is where the identifiers are going to come from?
    #the answer for this almost certainly is the data structure that
    #has uuids or the like baked in and references *could* work that way
    #BUT we don't need that for just the things in memory right now...
#how do we call a bulk update eg when we switch an axis?
    #step one we are in hierarchical exploration mode
    #step two we switch to axis mode with a set of objects, perhaps still in hier space

#XXX NOTE: currently this cannot be used effectively to track the positions of relations, which have 2 ends
    #at best realtions should probably be referenced as a tuple of MonoDict index values...
    #we might be able to do fast type inference, but then a relation could reference a relation and the
    #whole thing will come tumbling down
#basically when we deal with the relations between relations we will have to think a little bit harder about this
