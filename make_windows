1. install windows sdk 7.1 and vc 2010 c++ update
    a. if you have .NET 4.1+ you need to uninstall, you also need to uninstall any vc2010 redistributables otherwise the sdk install will fail
    b. make sure you install rc.exe! which is under c++ tools
    c. ammintrin.h may be missing in which case, get a newer verions and install using that
    d. congradulations, you are now a windows developer!
    e. sp1 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=4422
    f. sdk 7.1 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
2. download whichever panda source version you need
3. get rdb's win-libs-vc10-x64 
    a. extract to $PANDA_SOURCE_PATH/thirdpary
4. if you want to use your own version of python, copy your local install folder over win-python
    a. you may need to rename the python dll? :(
    b. sadly, no symlinks or shortcuts work for this which is silly since makepanda just copies from source to build
5. if you want nvidiagc, turns out its already in rdb's vc2010

bugs: makepanda.bat PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE = X86, PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 = AMD64, thus the switch at the start fails, nope, the problem would appear to be using powershell wtf, yeah, its powershell
    1. you must run compile from cmd, powershell's env has problems
    2. fix makepandacore.py:1845
    3. who knows why we're getting that memory access error ;_;
