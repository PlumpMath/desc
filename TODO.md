THIS SHALL BE A MODAL PROGRAM ALA VIM
we need modes so that we can handle the complexity

ideas:
 1. modes can also be selected/indicated visually to let people click
 2. in theory we might be able to use encodeToBamStream

modes:
 1. camera
 2. visual (select/explore/control what can be seen)
 3. insert (add a note or something?) implement last

accessible from everywhere except insert mode:
 1. search
 2. command line

things
======
 1. separate out the proceduarl object definitions into their own file
 2. keybinds config file: mapping from config names to functions
 3. CONCLUSION: do not use the scene graph for most things, it is simply too slow allow selection on sub components, or figure out how to thread this
 4. 4d grid plus the ability to zip through any 1 2 or 3 of the dimensions with a slider... 
 5. simple way to represent relations as lines with colors to mark their type
